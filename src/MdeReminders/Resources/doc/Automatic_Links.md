Title: Automatic Links

Markdown will automatically transform URLs or email addresses in "href" or "mailto" links.

    My paragraph with a link to <http://example.com/> and an email <address@email.com> to contact.

will produce:

    My paragraph with a link to <a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a> and an email <a href="mailto:address@email.com">address@email.com</a> to contact.

Email addresses are automatically anti-spammed.
