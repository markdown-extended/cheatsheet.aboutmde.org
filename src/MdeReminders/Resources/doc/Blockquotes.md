Block: Block Elements
Title: Blockquotes

Begin each line with a `>` sign.

    > This is my blockquote
    > and a second line ...

Other span and block elements are allowed inside a *blockquote* block as long as you
begin every line by `>`. The possible indentation of the included block begin after
this sign.

    > My citation
    >
    > With a paragraph and some `code`
    >
    >     and even a preformatted string
