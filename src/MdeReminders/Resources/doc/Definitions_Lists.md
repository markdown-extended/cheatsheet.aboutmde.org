Title: Definitions Lists

To build some definitions lists, just write each term on a seperate line, and each definition
on a new line, beginning with colon followed by 3 or more spaces.

You can write many definitions for a single term.

    Word
    :   Definition content (first one)
        with a two-lines text
    
    :   Second definition for this term...
