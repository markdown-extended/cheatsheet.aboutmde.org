Block: Span Elements
Title: Emphasis

Emphasis is written by surrounding word or expression between asterisks `*` or underscores `_`.

Bold text takes 2 of them.

    **my content** or __my content__

Italic text takes only one of them.

    *my content* or _my content_

Expressions or terms with underscores in emphasis span will be escaped.

    "_my_underscored_content_"

will produce: 

    "*my_underscored_content*"
    and not
    "*my* underscored *content*"
