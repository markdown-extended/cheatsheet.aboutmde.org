Title: Escaping

As Markdown is based on simple syntax wrapping parts of content between special signs,
to use them literally, these signs must be escaped with a backslash `\\`:

| `\\` backslash | `\.` dot | `\!` exclamation point | `\#` hash mark |
| `\*` asterisk | `\+` plus sign | `\-` hyphen | `\_` underscore |
| `\`` backtick quote | `\(\)` parentheses | `\[\]` brackets | `\{\}` curly brackets |
