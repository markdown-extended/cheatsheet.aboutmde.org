Block: Block Elements
Title: Lists

Begin each entry by an asterisk `*`, a plus `+` or an hyphen `-` followed by 3 spaces.

    -   first item
    -   second item

Each item must be on a separate line. You can write sub-items indenting these entries.

    -   first item
    -   second item
    -   first sub-item
    -   second sub-item

To build an ordered list, begin each entry by a number followed by a period and 3 spaces
(*the order of the written entries is not important*).

    1.   first item
    1.   second item

Other span and block elements are allowed inside each *list item* as long as you indent
all these blocks.
