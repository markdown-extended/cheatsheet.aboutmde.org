Title: Paragraphs & Breaks

A paragraph is just some consecutive lines of text, wrapped between blank lines (*or equivalent*).

        This is my first paragraph.

        And this is my second,
        on two lines ...

This means that if you want to see a line-break, you will have to write it litterally :

    This is a paragraph.
    <br />with a line-break ...
